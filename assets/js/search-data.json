            "content": "The idea of the Free Energy Principle has its foundations in Bayesian Inference, specifically Variational Bayesion Methods, as well as the theory of predictive coding. &#39;Inference&#39; in this case means infering the probability of a hidden state (or hypothesis) given an observation (evidence). This brings us to Bayes&#39; formula: . $$p(H|E) = displaystyle frac{p(E|H)p(H)}{p(E)}$$ . To see how this equation works in practice, let&#39;s introduce an example, taken from Bogacz&#39;s paper. . Consider a simple life form with one photo-sensitive receptor. This life form scuttles around trying to determine the size of objects around it based on reflective light. Let the size of an object = $v$. This simple life form has a difficult time perceiving the correct light intesnity as its photo-receptor provides a noisy input. Therefore when the size of an object is $v$, the organism perceives a normally distributed light intensity $p(u|v) =N(g(v), sum_u)$ where $g$ is a mapping of size to light intensity approximated by the organism. For now let $g(v) = v^2$. Addtionally, the organism has a prior assumption on the sizes of objects around it. For simplicity, let&#39;s imagine this prior as a normal distribution with mean $v_p$ and variance $ sum_p$. Therefore $p(v) = N(v_p, sum_p)$. We now have all the components necessary to construct Bayes&#39; theorem with $u$ as the evidence and $v$ as the hypothesis: . $p(v|u) = displaystyle frac{p(u|v)p(v)}{p(u)}$ . This, however, presents a problem. Calculating the numerator is easy, as it is described by the multiplication of two known normal distributions (stated above). The denominator, however, by the law of total probability, is expressed as: $p(u) = int p(u|v)p(v)dv$. In many scenarios, these integrals are intractable, and are especially impossible for organisms utilising neuronal connections for calculation. Therefore, the posterior distribution $p(v|u)$ needs to be calculated some other way. This is where Variational Bayes comes in. We might not be able to calculate the exact posterior, but we can try approximate it. To start, lets just consider a very coarse approximation of determining the mode of the posterior. In the case of our organism, the mode is important as it represents the most likely $v$ given the observed $u$ and the prior. It is reasonable to think that it is realistic and useful for organisms to only entertain most likely hypotheses rather than the probability of all possible hypotheses. Therefore we want to find the value of $v$ which is the maximum point of the posterior. Let this $v = phi = argmax_v p(v|u)$. The important part about estimating just one value of $v$ is that the denominator $p(u) = int p(u|v)p(v)$ does not depend on $ phi$ and is constant for any value $v$ of which we want to calculate the probability. Finding $ phi$ then simply becomes a case of finding the value of $v$ which maximises the numerator: $p(u|v)p(v)$ putting this all together, we have: . $max_vp(v|u) = p(u| phi)p( phi)$ . Now from here all we need do is iteratively determine $ phi$. This can be achieved via gradient ascent. We take the logarithm of the numerator because the maximum of it is the same as the maximum of $p(u|v)p(v)$ and is an easier function to work with as calculating $p(u|v)p(v)$ involves exponentiation: . $$ begin{align}F = ln(p(u|v)p(v)) end{align}$$ . $$ = ln(pu|v) + ln p(v)$$ . $= ln bigg[ displaystyle frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi Sigma_p}} bigg(-] displaystyle frac{( phi - v_p)^2}{2 Sigma_p} bigg) bigg] + ln bigg[ displaystyle frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi Sigma_u}}exp bigg(- displaystyle frac{(u - g( phi))^2}{2 Sigma_u} bigg) bigg]$ . $...$ . $...$ . $ = displaystyle frac{1}{2} bigg(- displaystyle frac{( phi - v_p)^2}{ Sigma_p}- displaystyle frac{(u-g( phi))^2}{ Sigma_u} bigg) + C$ . In the last line, all the constant terms not involving $ phi$ have been incorporated into a constant $C$ as they will disappear when the derivative is taken: . $ displaystyle frac{ partial F}{ partial phi} = displaystyle frac{v_p - phi}{ Sigma_p} + displaystyle frac{u-g( phi)}{ Sigma_u}g&#39;( phi)$ . With this equation we can pefrom gradient ascent until $ theta$ converges on a value. This will be the value which maximises $F$ and therefore maximises $p(v|u)$. Looking at the form of the equation, it is evident that the gradient of $F$ is being influenced in two different ways. One by how much the approximated hypothesis $ phi$ is different from the prior mean hypothesis and the other by how different the observation, $u$, is from the expected observation given the approxmated hypothesis $g( phi)$. There seems to be a tradeoff happening here. The prior and the likelihood are each pulling the posterior toward their mean values, with it ultimately being a weighted average between the two. The weighting here is exactly determined by the variance of the two terms respectively, with higher variance resulting in a less &#39;reliable&#39; contribution to the posterior. Ths makes sense, as the more noisy the prior or observation is, the less one would want it to contribute to the inference of a posterior hypothesis. . To frame this in terms of neuronal activity, let us denote these two terms in the derviative of $F$ as: . $ displaystyle epsilon_p = frac{ phi - v_p}{ Sigma_p}$ $ displaystyle epsilon_u = frac{u - g( phi)}{ Sigma_u}$ . As alluded to above, these can be viewed as weighted prediction errors and could be realised in a simple neuronal structure as follows: . . Here lines with arrows denote excitatory connections while lines with circles denote inhibitory connections. The circular connection between the prediction error nodes and the inference node allows for iterative update of all three as the maximum posterior is calculated. The update equations of the three inner nodes are as follows: . $ displaystyle phi_{new} = phi_{old} + a( epsilon_ug&#39;( phi) - epsilon_p)$ . $ displaystyle epsilon_{u_{new}} = epsilon_{u_{old}} + a(u - g( phi_{new}) - epsilon_{u_{old}} Sigma_u)$ . $ displaystyle epsilon_{p_{new}} = epsilon_{p_{old}} + a( phi_{new} - v_p - epsilon_{p_{old}} Sigma_p)$ . where $0&lt;a&lt;1$ is some constant to allow for better convergence. Note that in the update equation for $ phi$, the quantity from the excitatory &#39;evidence&#39; neuron $ epsilon_ug&#39;( phi)$ is being added, while the quantity from the inhibitory &#39;prior&#39; neuron $ epsilon_p$ is being subtracted. This exemplified the two componenets &#39;pulling&#39; the posterior in different directions as stated above. Also note that the error neurons are being self-inhibited by their respective variances, which represent the weighting on the components used in calculating the inferenced hypothesis. . The next step for the organism would be to shift its prior and likelihood calculation so as to better represent the new observation. In this case, it would mean changing the $v_p, Sigma_p$ and $ Sigma_u$ as well as sometimes the transformation function $g$. Essentailly, the organsim would like to maximise $p(u)$ on average. If it is constantly inferring hypotheses that it gives little prior probability to, $p(v)$, and little likelihood to, $p(u|v)$ perhaps it should adjust the parameters that determine these two factors. In bayesian Inference, this is what model evidence is, referred to in frequentist statistics as marginal likelihood. However trying to maximise $p(u)$ once again leaves us with the problem of the intractable marginalisation: $p(u) = int p(u|v)p(v)dv$. To avoid this we can turn to maximising a related and familiar expression: $p(u, phi)$. At first glance it might not seem clear why maximising this term, rather the whole model evidence, is useful. Remember that $p(u)$ essentially represents a weighted average of all possible likelihoods. However given that we are not necessarily attempting to calculate the entire posterior distribution, rather just one point of the posterior, it is reasonable to only care about maximising model evidence with respect to this point. Note that $p(u, phi) = p(u| phi)p( phi) = F$. Therefore by maximising $F$ with respect to the various parameters mentioned above will maximise the model evidence for the point of maximum likelihood, $ phi$. The update to these parameters would therefore be proportional to the derivative of $F$ with respect to each: . $ displaystyle frac{ partial F}{ partial v_p} = displaystyle frac{ phi - v_p}{ Sigma_p}$ . $ displaystyle frac{ partial F}{ partial Sigma_p} = displaystyle frac{1}{2} bigg( displaystyle frac{( phi - v_p)^2}{ Sigma_p^2} - displaystyle frac{1}{ Sigma_p} bigg)$ . $ displaystyle frac{ partial F}{ partial Sigma_u} = displaystyle frac{1}{2} bigg( displaystyle frac{(u - g( phi))^2}{ Sigma_u^2} - displaystyle frac{1}{ Sigma_u} bigg)$ . Additionally, the translation, $g$ may be incorrect. In its most complex form, updating this function would require the approximating power of a separate neural network. In its simplest form, the function form is static but weighted by a parameter $ theta$ which can represent the strength of the connection between the neurons which pass the translated data - in this case between the neurons computing $ epsilon_u$ and $ phi$ (see picture above). The update update to this weighting would therefore be: $ displaystyle frac{ partial F}{ partial theta} = epsilon_u phi$ . Free Energy . All this calculation has been for the purpose of two main things: Approximating the posterior distribution and maximising model evidence. We will now see that this can be approached from another angle. . Consider the goal of approximating the posterior. For the sake of simplicity, and we will continue on that vein, but this time treating that single value as a distribution, specifically a delta distribution with all its mass concentrated at one point which we will denote as $ phi$ (therefore has a 0 probability at every other point). This fits well with what we did above, however it is important to remember that we could use another known distribution, such as the normal, to approximate the posterior, however for now we will stick with the delta distribution. . Let $q(v)$ = the distribution to approximate the posterior (in this example remember q(v) is the delta distribution) We can take the KL-divergence between the two distributions to measure their similarity (with a KL-divergence of 0 meaning they are identical): . $KL(q(v), p(v|u)) = int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)}{p(v|u)}dv$ . substituting in the definition that $p(v|u) = large frac{p(u,v)}{p(u)}$ we have: . $KL(q(v), p(v|u)) = int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)p(u)}{p(v,u)}dv$ . $= int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)}{p(v,u)}dv + int q(v)dvlnp(u)$ . $= int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)}{p(v,u)}dv + lnp(u)$ . Going from the second to the third line we note that the integral of $q(v)$ is 1 and $lnp(u)$ is not a function of $v$ . Let $F = int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)}{p(v,u)}dv$. This term is known as negative Free Energy and is related to the KL-divergence by: . $KL(q(v), p(v|u)) = -F + lnp(u)$ . Now because $lnp(u)$ does not depend on $q$, the minimisation of the KL divergence between the two distributions can be achieved by maximising $F$. In this case, the value of $ phi$ that minimises the distance between $q(v)$ and $p(v|u)$ is the value of $ phi$ which maximises $F$. To go full circle, we will evaluate $F$ a little more: . $F = int q(v)ln displaystyle frac{q(v)}{p(v,u)}dv$ . $ = int q(v)lnp(u,v)dv - int q(v)lnp(v)dv$ . Using the property of the delta function which states that for $ delta(x)$ with center $ phi$, for any function $h(x)$, the integral of $ delta(x)h(x)$ is equal to $h( phi)$. Therefore: . $F = lnp(u, phi) + C$. . We can change the second integral in the expression to a constant as it does not depend on $ phi$ and will cancel when we take the derivative. This expression is exactly the same as $F$ calculated in the previous section, and it should be, as approximating a distribution with the delta distribution is the same as approximating it with a single point ($ phi$). Also note that $lnp(u) = F + KL(q(v), p(v|u))$. Since the KL-divergence is non-negative, the minimum the log model evidence can be is $F$. Therefore $F$ acts as a lower bound to model evidence, and maximising it via model parameters (as we did in the previous section) maximises the lower bound on model evidence. . Thus maximising $F$ serves to both maximise the approximate distribution, and optimise model parameters. .",
